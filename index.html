        Some things you think will be simple actually end up getting really complex. Google knows this all to well, which is why it recently rolled out a brand new Google Calendar -- and plenty of nifty features to go with it.

While a few features in the latest Google Calendar aren't new, they have changed somewhat. Still other features you might not know exist at all. Let's go over all of them to make your life a little easier.

Your Google Calendar comes with your personal Gmail address, and you won't believe how simple it is to use and set up. But if you work at a company that uses its own Google Calendar, you suddenly have to find out how best to integrate your personal calendar with your weekly meeting schedule.

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      
  
      <p>
        With Google Calendar, you can quickly schedule meetings and events and get reminders about upcoming activities, so you always know what’s next. Calendar is designed for teams, so it’s easy to share your schedule with others and create multiple calendars that you and your team can use together.
